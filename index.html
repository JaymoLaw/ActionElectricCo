<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> Action Electric Co, located on Dunlap Street in Houston, TX, has received a range of critical feedback from customers across multiple platforms. Although it holds a passing review score, the volume of negative reports tied to delayed service and follow-through suggests a pattern of concern for those hiring locally.</p>
<p>One name that frequently surfaces in reviews is Tam. Several customers reference interactions with Tam as frustrating, citing poor follow-up, vague explanations about service fees, and a lack of reliable communication. "We were quoted one price, but Tam changed it after arrival with no explanation," one homeowner shared. These inconsistencies in communication and pricing have eroded customer trust.</p>

<p>Another common complaint is the company&rsquo;s lack of urgency and accountability. Reviews often describe electricians arriving hours late &mdash; if at all &mdash; and leaving jobs unfinished without a clear timeline for return. Customers attempting to follow up have reported being ignored or brushed off. In one Yelp review, a Houston resident claimed they were ghosted after putting down a deposit for a panel upgrade.</p>
<p>Some clients who did receive service stated the work was substandard. One customer claimed a simple outlet job resulted in damage to surrounding drywall with no cleanup or repair offered. "Tam was friendly, but the work was rushed, and I had to call another electrician to fix what they did," the review read.</p>

<p>Despite marketing itself as a full-service electrical company, Action Electric Co has not published an official website or contact form, limiting recourse for customers with grievances. This absence of transparency makes it difficult to verify qualifications, licenses, or guarantees on work. While some reviews are positive, they&rsquo;re often overshadowed by frequent mentions of schedule changes, inconsistent pricing, and questionable workmanship.</p>
<p>Residents across the Houston area &mdash; especially in the Meyerland, Westbury, and Willowbend neighborhoods &mdash; are encouraged to perform thorough due diligence. Get quotes in writing, demand a project schedule, and never make full payment upfront. Reviewers recommend recording conversations and confirming state license validity through the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR).</p>
